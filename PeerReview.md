# From Vincent
`git log` will show all the information you need. But the whole situation is like this:

I have created the whole framework for creating a game (super classes, interfaces, functions for each classes and so on). `GameCharacter`, character ability, cooldowns, `GameMap`, `GameMatch` and so on. I provided templates for Rain to implement new items, maps, abilities and so on. For example, `SmallHpPotion`, `StrengthPotion`, `WeaponHands` are such templates.

Rain is the one who create content using the framework. Story, items (like Medium Potion), map (Dungeon) are created by Rain.
